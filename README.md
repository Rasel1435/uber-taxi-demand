# Data Information
Get the data from: [http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) (2022-2023 data) The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)

## Information on taxis:
<b> Yellow Taxi: Yellow Medallion Taxicabs </b> <br>
These famous NYC yellow taxis provide transportation exclusively through street hails. The number of taxicabs is limited by a finite number of medallions issued by the TLC. You access this mode of transportation by standing in the street and hailing an available taxi with your hand. The pickups are not pre-arranged.

<b> For Hire Vehicles (FHVs) </b> <br>
A pre-arrangement with a dispatcher or limo company accesses FHV transportation. These FHVs are not permitted to pick up passengers via street hails, as those rides are not considered pre-arranged.

<b> Green Taxi: Street Hail Livery (SHL) </b> <br>
The SHL program will allow livery vehicle owners to license and outfit their vehicles with green borough taxi branding, meters, credit card machines, and ultimately the right to accept street hails in addition to pre-arranged rides.


<b> Footnote: </b> <br>
In the given notebook we are considering only the yellow taxis for the time between 2022 - 2023
# ML Problem Formulation
<b> Time-series forecasting and Regression </b>


- To find the number of pickups, given location coordinates (latitude and longitude), and time, in the query region and surrounding regions.
To solve the above, we would use data collected in 2022 - 2023.

# Performance metrics
- rmse = mean squared error.
- mape = mean absolute percentage error.
- mae = mean absolute error.
- r2 = r2 score.
